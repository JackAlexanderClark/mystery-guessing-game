# **I) Project Goals

1. For this project I decided upon a guessing game as a foundation, that would allow user inputs and ability to interact with different areas of the project. However, I wanted to expand upon this with added complexity and a more in-depth story. The game is inspired by the board game Cluedo and to get an aesthetically pleasing layout I commision some artwork to be produced for the characters in the game. I wanted the players to look like a playing card to brinbg that trading card game/board game to life, as seen below; ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97599832/212542303-b60b7be1-4f68-4a37-becc-c9d197ef0983.png)

2. One of the main javascript features I wanted to use was exploring and interacting with elements to learn more information and details towards the game. Clicking to expand paragraphs and navigate was a key goal.
